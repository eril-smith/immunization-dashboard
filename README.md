# Immunization Dashboard

This repository contains the **Immunization Dashboard**, a Tableau visualization of flu shot compliance using Synthea-generated patient data for the year 2022. The dashboard explores vaccination trends within a simulated healthcare system and highlights demographic and geographic breakdowns of flu shot uptake.

## Dashboard Features

- Filterable map to view flu shot data by county
- Total flu shots given and compliance rate for 2022
- Running sum of flu shots administered throughout the year
- Compliance breakdowns by:
  - Age group
  - Race
  - County
- Patient-level table showing individuals who received flu shots, including their age and compliance status

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparing tables for analysis
- **Tableau**: Used for dashboard design and visualization

## Dataset

- **Source**: Synthea (Synthetic Patient Generator)
- **Type**: Simulated patient-level immunization data for the year 2022
- **Note**: This dataset is synthetically generated and does not represent real patient information.
